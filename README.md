Written in python with PyQt6. Tested on tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.7-alpha, tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.8-alpha and tes3mp.Win64.release.0.8.1.

How to use:

When program starts (either through .py script or through .exe file) a window pops up asking user to select a folder with the tes3mp mod: "tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.7-alpha", "tes3mp.Win64.prerelease.0.8-alpha" or "tes3mp.Win64.release.0.8.1".

This is where all of the config files are stored.

It updates config files on the fly.

All credtis to the original mod are stored in the text file.
